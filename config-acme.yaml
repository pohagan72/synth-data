  # Scenario Filter: Control which investigation scenarios to include
  # Options:
  #   'all'              - Include all scenarios (default)
  #   'antitrust'        - Price-fixing investigation (S1, S1A, S1B) + noise + privilege
  #   'safety_fraud'     - Product safety fraud investigation (S2) + noise + privilege
  #   'hr_misconduct'    - HR/workplace investigation + noise + privilege
  #   'antitrust_only'   - Only S1 scenarios, NO noise or privilege (use '_only' suffix)
  #   ['antitrust', 'safety_fraud'] - Multiple investigation types (list format)
  #
  # Note: Attorney-client privilege (S3) is now included with ALL investigations
  # as it's a review/screening task, not an investigation type.
  #
  # Contextual noise (S3-S15) includes: Privilege docs, HR announcements,
  # project management, personal emails, meeting scheduling, etc.
  #
  # RECOMMENDED: For focused EAIDA demos, use single investigation type
  # EXAMPLE: scenario_filter: 'antitrust'
  scenario_filter: 'all'
