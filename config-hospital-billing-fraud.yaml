# MEDICARE/MEDICAID BILLING FRAUD INVESTIGATION DATASET - FOCUSED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# This config generates a focused dataset for Medicare/Medicaid billing fraud
# investigations. Perfect for EAIDA demos of fraud detection and compliance analysis.
#
# Key Scenarios (NOW AVAILABLE):
# - Main fraud thread: Discovery of systematic upcoding (S_FRAUD)
# - Kickback scheme with medical device vendor (S_FRAUD_A)
# - False claims - billing for services not rendered (S_FRAUD_B)
# - Pressure on billing staff to maximize reimbursement (S_FRAUD_C)
# - Destruction of audit evidence (S_FRAUD_D)
# - Calendar event: Secret meeting about "revenue optimization" (S_FRAUD_E)
# - Teams/Slack chat about coding "creatively" (S_FRAUD_F)
# - Attorney-client privilege documents (S3 - automatic with all investigations)
# - Realistic healthcare business noise for context (S4-S18)
#
# Investigation Narrative:
# Riverside Regional Medical Center, a 350-bed community hospital in suburban Virginia,
# became the subject of a federal Medicare/Medicaid fraud investigation in early 2024
# after a whistleblower complaint from a former medical billing specialist.
#
# Key Timeline:
# - January 2022: CFO Richard Brennan initiates "revenue optimization" strategy
# - March 2022: Billing Director Susan Walsh implements systematic upcoding protocols
# - June 2022: Kickback arrangement established with MedTech Solutions Inc. (device vendor)
# - September 2022: Dr. Marcus Chen (Senior Physician) begins participating in upcoding scheme
# - December 2022: Compliance Officer Linda Martinez raises initial concerns (ignored)
# - March 2023: Internal audit by Jennifer Taylor (Coding Auditor) finds discrepancies
# - May 2023: Evidence of phantom billing (services never rendered) emerges
# - August 2023: Billing staff report pressure to "maximize codes" and "be creative"
# - October 2023: Senior coder Karen Phillips documents destruction of audit records
# - January 2024: Whistleblower files qui tam lawsuit under False Claims Act
# - February 2024: Federal investigation launched (DOJ, HHS-OIG)
# - March 2024: Document preservation orders issued
#
# Key Players (Core 5 Custodians):
# - Richard Brennan (CFO): Architect of the fraud scheme, financial mastermind
# - Susan Walsh (Billing Director/Revenue Cycle Director): Implemented upcoding protocols
# - Linda Martinez (Compliance Officer): Raised concerns early, eventually threatened resignation
# - Dr. Marcus Chen (Senior Physician - Cardiology): Participated in upcoding, performed unnecessary procedures
# - Thomas Harper (General Counsel): Advised on legal risks, involved in privilege discussions
#
# Types of Fraud Identified:
# 1. Upcoding: Billing higher-level E&M codes (99215 instead of 99213), upgrading procedures
# 2. Kickbacks: Receiving payments from MedTech Solutions for device referrals (Anti-Kickback Statute violation)
# 3. Phantom Billing: Billing for services never rendered (ghost patients, cancelled appointments)
# 4. Unbundling: Separating procedure codes to maximize reimbursement
# 5. Obstruction: Destruction of audit documents, pressure on staff to falsify records
#
# Discovery Mechanism:
# - Whistleblower: Former medical billing specialist Karen Phillips filed qui tam lawsuit
# - Initial tip to HHS-OIG hotline in January 2024
# - Internal audit findings by Jennifer Taylor (suppressed by management)
# - Pattern analysis by Medicare contractor showing abnormal billing patterns
#
# Estimated Financial Impact:
# - $8.7 million in fraudulent Medicare claims (2022-2023)
# - $2.3 million in fraudulent Medicaid claims (2022-2023)
# - $850,000 in kickback payments from MedTech Solutions
# - Potential treble damages under False Claims Act: $33 million
# - Civil penalties: Additional $11-22 million
# - Criminal exposure for key individuals
# ===================================================================


# Personnel:
# - 5 core custodians (Richard Brennan, Susan Walsh, Linda Martinez, Dr. Marcus Chen, Thomas Harper)
# - 45 expansion personnel for organizational depth and realistic noise
# - Signal scenarios focus on core custodians, noise uses full roster
