# ===================================================================
# PATIENT HARM INVESTIGATION DATASET - FOCUSED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# This config generates a focused dataset for medical malpractice/negligence
# with coverup investigations. Perfect for EAIDA demos of evidence tampering
# and obstruction of justice detection in healthcare settings.
#
# Key Scenarios (NOW AVAILABLE):
# - Serious adverse event email threads (S_HARM)
# - Initial incident reports showing concerns (S_HARM_A)
# - Pressure to modify/falsify medical records (S_HARM_B)
# - Destruction of evidence communications (S_HARM_C)
# - Intimidation of staff witnesses (S_HARM_D)
# - Abuse of peer review privilege (S_HARM_E)
# - Calendar: Secret "narrative management" meeting (S_HARM_F)
# - Teams/Slack: Panic after adverse event (S_HARM_G)
# - Attorney-client privilege documents (S3 - automatic with all investigations)
# - Abuse of peer review privilege to hide evidence (S3F)
# - Realistic healthcare business noise for context (S4-S18)
#
# Investigation Narrative:
# On March 15, 2024, a 58-year-old patient named Robert Hendricks underwent
# routine left knee arthroscopy at St. Catherine's Regional Hospital. Due to
# a series of errors, the surgical team operated on the WRONG SITE (right knee
# instead of left), resulting in unnecessary surgery. The error was discovered
# post-operatively when the patient complained of continued left knee pain.
#
# Timeline of Event and Coverup:
# - March 15, 2024, 8:30 AM: Wrong-site surgery performed by Dr. Marcus Chen
# - March 15, 2024, 2:00 PM: Error discovered in recovery; patient severely distressed
# - March 15, 2024, 3:00 PM: Charge Nurse Sarah Morrison files incident report
# - March 16, 2024: Risk Management Director Patricia Vasquez convenes emergency meeting
# - March 17-20, 2024: Pressure campaign begins to modify incident reports
# - March 21, 2024: General Counsel David Park advises "narrative management"
# - March 22-25, 2024: Original incident reports destroyed; altered versions created
# - March 26, 2024: Nurse Morrison threatened with termination for "insubordination"
# - March 27-30, 2024: Peer review committee convened to claim privilege over evidence
# - April 1-5, 2024: Cover story established: "Patient gave conflicting consent"
#
# Key Players:
# - Dr. Evelyn Hart (CMO): Aware of coverup, authorized "incident management"
# - Dr. Marcus Chen (Attending Surgeon): Performed wrong-site surgery, participated in coverup
# - Sarah Morrison (Charge Nurse): Witnessed error, filed initial report, later intimidated
# - Patricia Vasquez (Risk Management Director): Orchestrated coverup, destroyed evidence
# - David Park (General Counsel): Advised on legal strategy, abused peer review privilege
#
# Patient Outcome:
# Robert Hendricks suffered unnecessary surgery on healthy right knee, requiring additional
# corrective surgery. Left knee condition worsened due to surgical delay. Psychological
# trauma from betrayal of trust. Patient ultimately died from post-operative complications
# following emergency corrective surgery on April 15, 2024.
#
# Evidence Trail:
# - Original incident reports (timestamped March 15-16) showing immediate concerns
# - Modified incident reports (created March 22-23) downplaying severity
# - Email thread showing pressure to "revise" documentation
# - Calendar invite for "Risk Mitigation Strategy Session" (code for coverup meeting)
# - Teams chat showing panic: "We need to get our story straight"
# - Surgical logs with unexplained gaps and alterations
# - Peer review committee minutes improperly claiming privilege over non-medical discussions
# - Witness statements showing coercion: "You need to remember it differently"
#
# Investigation Focus:
# This dataset demonstrates both medical negligence AND criminal obstruction:
# - Wrong-site surgery (medical malpractice)
# - Falsification of medical records (criminal fraud)
# - Destruction of evidence (obstruction of justice)
# - Witness intimidation (witness tampering)
# - Abuse of peer review privilege (spoliation of evidence)
# - Conspiracy to defraud patient and regulators
# ===================================================================

The minutes should reveal the meeting discussed topics that are NOT legitimate quality improvement: 'Documentation consistency strategy', 'Alignment of witness statements', 'Family communication talking points', 'Media response preparation', 'Settlement negotiation parameters'. These are legal and PR strategy topics being improperly cloaked in peer review privilege. The presence of General Counsel David Park as a primary participant (rather than consultant) further demonstrates this is not genuine peer review."

David summarizes the peer review committee's 'recommendations' which are actually legal strategy decisions: implementing 'revised incident documentation', 'consistent staff messaging', and 'proactive family engagement to assess settlement appetite'. He emphasizes that 'all of these discussions and documents are protected from discovery by peer review privilege'. This demonstrates clear abuse of the privilege to hide evidence of coverup."
