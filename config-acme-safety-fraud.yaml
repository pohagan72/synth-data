# ===================================================================
# PRODUCT SAFETY FRAUD DATASET - FOCUSED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# This config generates a focused dataset for product liability and
# safety fraud investigations. Perfect for EAIDA demos of regulatory
# violations and test result manipulation.
#
# Key Scenarios (NOW AVAILABLE):
# - Project Phoenix safety test failure coverup (S2)
# - Email thread about hiding catastrophic test results
# - Data manipulation and evidence destruction orders
# - Falsified safety reports sent to clients (Coyote Industries)
# - Executive involvement (CEO CC'd on destruction order)
# - Calendar invites for safety review meetings, client presentations (S2A-S2D)
# - Attorney-client privilege documents (S3 - automatic with all investigations)
# - R&D/engineering contextual noise for realism (S4-S13)
#
# Investigation Narrative:
# Casey Mitchell (R&D Lead) and Peyton Parker (QA Specialist) discover
# catastrophic failure in Project Phoenix safety tests. Instead of reporting,
# they agree to hide evidence, manipulate sensor data, and send falsified
# report to client Coyote Industries. CEO Taylor Brooks is CC'd on key emails.
#
# Signal/Noise Ratio Tuning:
# - This config includes duplicate noise scenarios (S4 duplicated 4x)
# - Current ratio: ~40% signal (10 signal / 25 total scenarios - includes calendar events)
# - Target ratio: ~25% signal / 75% noise
# - For further tuning: Generate 1500-2000 items or add more noise duplicates
