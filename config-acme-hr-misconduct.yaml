# HR MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATION DATASET - FOCUSED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# This config generates a focused dataset for HR and workplace
# misconduct investigations. Perfect for EAIDA demos of harassment,
# discrimination, abuse of resources, and hostile work environment.
#
# Key Scenarios (NOW AVAILABLE):
# - Workplace harassment communications (complaint to GC)
# - HR investigation documentation and witness statements
# - Inappropriate after-hours chat messages
# - Executive response to harassment allegations
# - Investigation meeting calendar invites (complaint, witness interviews, executive review, follow-up)
# - Attorney-client privilege documents (automatic with all investigations)
# - HR/employee relations contextual noise
#
# Investigation Narrative:
# Peyton Parker reports to Drew Foster (GC) about inappropriate comments
# and behavior from Jamie Chen. Investigation includes witness statements,
# documentation, and executive decision-making.
#
# Personnel:
# - 5 core custodians (Taylor, Jamie, Casey, Peyton, Drew)
# - 45 expansion personnel for organizational depth and realistic noise
# - Signal scenarios focus on core custodians, noise uses full roster
#
# Signal/Noise Ratio Tuning:
# - This config includes duplicate noise scenarios (S4 duplicated 4x)
# - Current ratio: ~48% signal (13 signal / 27 total scenarios)
# - For ~25% signal ratio: Generate 1500-2000 items (noise repeats more)
# - Or add more noise duplicates at the end of the file
