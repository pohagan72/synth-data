# ===================================================================
# HIPAA DATA BREACH INVESTIGATION DATASET - FOCUSED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================
# This config generates a focused dataset for HIPAA data breach
# investigations. Perfect for EAIDA demos of breach detection and response.
#
# Key Scenarios (NOW AVAILABLE):
# - Main breach thread: Unauthorized database access (S_HIPAA)
# - Evidence of data exfiltration (S_HIPAA_A)
# - Delayed breach notification/violations (S_HIPAA_B)
# - Coverup attempts/evidence destruction (S_HIPAA_C)
# - Emergency response meeting calendar event (S_HIPAA_D)
# - Teams/Slack chat about the breach (S_HIPAA_E)
# - Attorney-client privilege documents (S3 - automatic with all investigations)
# - Realistic healthcare business noise for context (S4-S18)
#
# Investigation Narrative:
# On March 15, 2024, Metropolitan General Hospital's IT Security team discovered
# unauthorized access to the patient database system. Investigation revealed that
# an external attacker exploited misconfigured database credentials left exposed
# in a GitHub repository by a junior developer (Kevin Ramirez, IT Dept).
#
# Key Timeline:
# - March 8: Initial unauthorized access begins (undetected)
# - March 15: IT Director Morgan Chen discovers suspicious database queries
# - March 16: CISO Dr. Patricia Williams confirms data exfiltration (47,892 patient records)
# - March 17-20: Executive team debates notification timing (HIPAA requires 60 days)
# - March 21: General Counsel David Foster advises immediate notification
# - March 22: CMO Dr. James Morrison raises concerns about reputational damage
# - March 23-25: Evidence of attempted coverup by COO attempting to delay disclosure
# - March 26: Compliance Officer Rebecca Santos threatens resignation if not reported
# - March 27: External forensics firm (CyberShield Partners) engaged
# - March 28: Mandatory breach notification sent to HHS OCR (barely within 60-day window)
#
# Key Players:
# - Dr. Patricia Williams (CISO): Discovered breach, pushed for immediate disclosure
# - Morgan Chen (IT Director): First responder, technical investigation lead
# - Rebecca Santos (Compliance Officer): HIPAA compliance enforcer, threatened resignation
# - Dr. James Morrison (CMO): Initially resistant to disclosure due to reputation concerns
# - David Foster (General Counsel): Advised immediate notification to avoid penalties
# - Kevin Ramirez (Junior Developer): Inadvertently exposed credentials on GitHub
# - Sarah Thompson (COO): Attempted to delay notification (not a core custodian but appears in scenarios)
#
# Evidence Trail:
# - Database access logs showing unauthorized queries
# - GitHub commit history showing exposed credentials
# - Email threads debating notification timing
# - Calendar invites for emergency response meetings
# - Slack messages discussing breach details
# - Forensic investigation reports
# - Draft breach notification letters (multiple versions with changing timelines)
# ===================================================================


# Personnel:
# - 5 core custodians (Dr. Williams, Morgan Chen, Rebecca Santos, Dr. Morrison, David Foster)
# - 45 expansion personnel for organizational depth and realistic noise
# - Signal scenarios focus on core custodians, noise uses full roster
